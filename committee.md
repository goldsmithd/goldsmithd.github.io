We quite enjoy our various roles and our interaction with Members and the public. We liaise with other local and national organisations, including particularly Dorset Police. We try to improve the environment in which we live and we think it is important to all of us living in the Merley area. Being a committee member is not onerous and for the right person is quite rewarding. Inevitably there is a social aspect too so anyone interested is encouraged to approach our Chairman Anne. Ideally, we would always like a minimum of eight Members on the committee. We are also always looking for inspiration and constructive ideas that can be used for the benefit of all. Do contact us with your thoughts.

We have Coordinators covering most of our area. Their role is in many ways, the most important. Unless you have elected to receive your Newsletter as an e-mail attachment, Coordinators deliver Newsletters to your door four times each year and collect Membership Subscriptions once each year. They are the eyes and ears of your Watch. They are all volunteers as well who want to support our Community. Do please talk to them on any issue you consider important and relevant.
